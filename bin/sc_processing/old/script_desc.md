Order of scripts:
mex_to_csv.sh -> 10x_to_sparse_mat.py -> general_sc_data_processing.ipynb

mex_to_csv.sh: 
* foldes to be processed inside the script need to be modified. 
* Make sure that the files inside your folders have the correct names, sometimes they are named slightly different (i.e. genes vs features, I assume it depends on the version)
* Taken from 10x site: https://kb.10xgenomics.com/hc/en-us/articles/360023793031-How-can-I-convert-the-feature-barcode-matrix-from-Cell-Ranger-3-to-a-CSV-file- 

10x_to_sparse_mat.py -f YOUR_FOLDER(S)_HERE : 
* creates a matrix generated by mex_to_csv.sh in your folder and makes it into a sparse matrix ready to be used in the "general_sc_data_processing" jupyter notebook
